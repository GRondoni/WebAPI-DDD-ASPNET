Simple web API project in ASP.NET Core applying concepts from the DDD structure.

Project Description
Cross-platform API with ASP.NET Core 6 using C# as the programming language, DDD architecture for modeling, SQL SERVER for the database, and Entity Framework Core as the ORM for mapping between DTO (Data Transfer Object) and Domain Models using AutoMapper.

Implemented JWT (JSON Web Token) for generating tokens to be consumed with external applications or Front-End.

Used Swagger to document the API.

Can be executed on Windows, Linux, and Mac.
